Chapter I: Introduction

Vehicular emissions are a leading cause of air pollution in cities with dense traffic. These emissions include carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. CO is especially dangerous because it is colorless and odorless. It comes from incomplete fuel combustion in engines. Once inhaled, CO binds to hemoglobin faster than oxygen, reducing oxygen delivery and causing serious health problems such as headaches, dizziness, heart strain, and even death (Manisalidis et al., 2020).

Efforts like catalytic converters and emission regulations have lowered pollution, but challenges persist. Converters perform poorly during cold starts when emissions peak. Their effectiveness declines with vehicle age or poor maintenance (Hu et al., 2023). Drivers also lack real-time information on their vehicles' emission levels. Without monitoring, compliance with environmental standards is harder to maintain.

This study introduces CO-SAFE (Carbon Monoxide Smart AI-Powered Filtration for Exhaust). The system combines multi-layer filtration, AI-powered CO detection, and mobile alerts. It filters carbon monoxide, monitors filter performance, and warns drivers when levels rise. By integrating filtration with smart monitoring, CO-SAFE improves beyond conventional exhaust systems. The goal is to lower CO emissions while giving vehicle owners tools to reduce pollution and support healthier transportation.

Rationale

Air pollution from vehicles continues to harm urban communities. Carbon monoxide, which is one of its emissions, is one of the most dangerous gases because it is invisible and toxic. Traditional exhaust systems reduce emissions, but their performance declines with age and poor maintenance (Manisalidis et al., 2020). Drivers also lack real-time data on their emissions, which limits their ability to respond.

To address these gaps, intelligent exhaust systems combine filtration with monitoring. CO-SAFE uses activated coconut shells and eggshells as filters to trap harmful gases. These natural materials are low-cost and sustainable, making them practical for local use. At the same time, an AI-powered sensor tracks emission levels in real time. When levels rise, the system sends a mobile alert so you can take immediate action. This link between engineering and digital monitoring strengthens both safety and accountability.

Sustainable transportation requires both cleaner technology and informed drivers. CO-SAFE supports this goal by lowering carbon monoxide emissions, improving air quality, and promoting eco-conscious behavior. By connecting natural filter materials with smart detection and mobile alerts, the system provides a clear step toward safer roads and healthier cities.

Theoretical Background

The theoretical foundation of the CO-SAFE (Carbon Monoxide Smart AI-Powered Filtration for Exhaust) system draws upon several perspectives that explain its design, adoption, and contribution to sustainability. Systems Theory by von Bertalanffy (1968) emphasizes that a system must be understood holistically, with all components interacting as a unified whole. Vehicular emissions, for instance, result from the interplay of combustion processes, exhaust mechanisms, environmental conditions, and user practices. CO-SAFE embodies this system's perspective by combining multi-layer filtration, AI-powered detection, and mobile alerts into an integrated emission management approach.

The Technology Acceptance Model proposed by Davis (1989) highlights that the adoption of a new technology is largely determined by its perceived usefulness and ease of use. CO-SAFE addresses these factors by demonstrating clear benefits in reducing carbon monoxide emissions and providing real-time monitoring, while also ensuring a user-friendly interface through mobile alerts and seamless installation in vehicles. This increases the likelihood of driver acceptance and widespread utilization of the system. The Environmental Kuznets Curve Hypothesis, advanced by Grossman and Krueger (1995), suggests that environmental degradation initially increases with economic growth but eventually decreases as societies embrace cleaner technologies. CO-SAFE aligns with this hypothesis by representing a technological advancement that mitigates vehicular emissions, contributing to a transition toward cleaner and more sustainable urban environments.

In addition, Feedback Control Theory introduced by Wiener (1948) underscores the role of continuous monitoring, feedback, and corrective action in maintaining system effectiveness. CO-SAFE reflects this principle by using sensors to detect CO levels in real time, AI algorithms to process the data, and mobile alerts to trigger timely user responses such as filter replacement or maintenance. This ensures that the system adapts dynamically to emission fluctuations, maintaining efficiency under diverse operating conditions.

Finally, Ecological Modernization Theory by Mol and Spaargaren (2000) argues that technological innovation and environmental sustainability can reinforce one another. Rather than treating industrial development as inherently harmful, this perspective emphasizes innovation as a pathway toward ecological improvement. CO-SAFE exemplifies this principle by merging AI, IoT, and advanced filtration technologies to reduce carbon monoxide emissions while fostering proactive user engagement in sustainable practices.

Theoretical Framework

The figure below illustrates the different system combinations that will be needed to construct the CO-SAFE: Carbon Monoxide Smart AI-Powered Filtration for Exhaust- Smart Multi-Layer Exhaust Filtration System with AI-Powered CO Detection and Mobile.

This system's real-time feedback and advanced filtration are vital for emissions reduction. Employing feedback control theory, the system can continually monitor exhaust output and respond in real-time to emission level deviations. Corrective action will automatically be taken—if applicable—through altering the parameters of fuel combustion or improving filter performance—to remain in an optimal operation mode. In parallel, high-efficient filter technology captures and destroys harmful particulates and gases prior to their release into the environment. The integration of real-time monitoring and filtration will not only reduce air pollutants but also help in making the system sustainable, reconciling the goals of environmental protection with the demands of technological innovation.

In environmental policy, the system supports data-driven emission reduction by providing real-time monitoring and reporting of harmful gases, which can be used to guide more effective regulations and sustainable practices. For the automotive industry, the study offers insights into how AI-based exhaust technologies can be integrated into vehicles to not only meet stricter emission standards but also enhance safety and efficiency.

Beyond technical applications, the CO-SAFE system contributes to raising public awareness and improving community health. Through mobile alerts, drivers are encouraged to adopt more eco-conscious behaviors, fostering responsibility toward reducing harmful emissions. At the societal level, this study emphasizes the long-term benefits of cleaner air and healthier living conditions by addressing carbon monoxide emissions at their source. Overall, the CO-SAFE system highlights the value of combining innovation, sustainability, and public responsibility in creating solutions that benefit both people and the environment.

Chapter II: Review of Related Literature

Filtration System in Reducing CO Emissions

Filtration systems are used inside combustion engines and in vehicle cabins to reduce harmful pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO). CO is a toxic gas that is mainly produced during the incomplete combustion of fuels and is characterized as being colorless and odorless. Health detriment is caused by prolonged exposure to CO. It is a factor to consider when optimizing a system's design for evaluating CO reductions across multiple filter layers and the repeatability of results across trials.

Trials have shown that whale diesel filters successfully achieve average reductions of 28% of CO beside other pollutant reductions like oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons. With the findings being consistent across various types of vehicles, the performance remained staunch across trials for various years (Pilusa and Muzenda, 2013). In contrast to Mayer et al. (2009) briefly studying partial flow filtration, who maintained that the performance varied greatly, with maximum CO reductions anywhere from less than 30% to 63%. Furthermore, these filters were prone to releasing previously trapped pollutants under certain driving conditions, which undermines their reliability and consistency. Other studies have confirmed that fuel filtration systems and catalytic layers work in reducing CO emission, but the purely mechanical or partial flow designs often produce inconsistent results upon repeated trials.

(Diagram 2.1: Jiang Hongming's Exhaust Purifier of Automobile 2018)
One system for treatment of automotive exhaust that has a patent is Jiang Hongming's Exhaust Purifier of Automobile (CN108131180A) in China. This design has an outer sleeve, creates heat and is attached to the exhaust pipe. The inner sleeve has a filter element with multiple layers. The layers consist of activated carbon, HEPA membranes, porous ceramics, inorganic glass fiber, and normal cloth. Chemical membranes also target hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, lead, and sulfur oxides. Absorbent materials target carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. This allows the exhaust gases to go through physical and chemical filtration before they are released. The design can reduce the emissions that contribute to smog or haze in our air. This system also demonstrates a structured system of treatment of emissions (Jiang, 2018).

(Diagram 2.2: Exhaust Gas Purifying Agent for Automobiles by Chie Yasunaga, 2020)
A different approach was developed in the United States by Chie Yasunaga, assigned to Eishin Co., Ltd. The invention is the Exhaust Gas Purifying Agent for Automobiles (US20200384443B2). This method does not use mechanical filters. Instead, it uses a liquid sprayed onto the air filter. The liquid contains tourmaline fine powder, porous mineral powders, and natural compounds from seaweed, such as fucoidan, amino peptides, and alginic acids. The formulation reduces harmful exhaust gases and improves fuel mileage. The spraying method makes application simple. It also extends the duration of the filtering effect. This reduces cost and increases practicality compared to fixed filtration systems (Yasunaga, 2020).

(Diagram 2.3: Smoke Filter for Motorized Vehicles by Paño et al., 2019)
Wu Zhifeng in China developed the Environmental Protection Filtration Device for Automobile Exhaust (CN204457949U). The design is simple. It uses a cone-shaped air inlet pipe connected to a protective shell. The shell holds a water-filled chamber that traps pollutants. The exhaust flows through a U-shaped pipe in the water before going out. A filter screen at the outlet improves the effect. This system adapts to different exhaust pipe sizes. It is affordable and easy to apply. Water traps gases and particles. It may not be as advanced as other filters, but it is a practical way to reduce toxic gases in low-resource areas (Wu, 2015).

The Philippines introduced another innovation, Smoke Filter for Motorized Vehicles (1/2019/000047) uses powdered lime from land snail shells as its core material. This powder has high adsorptive capacity. It removes hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide effectively. The powdered lime is enclosed in an aluminum tube casing. The casing withstands the high heat of mufflers. The approach uses locally available materials. It supports sustainable design and low-cost solutions. By reducing common exhaust pollutants, the device addresses urban air quality issues and highlights the potential of natural resources in emission reduction (Paño et al., 2019).

These patents show four different strategies. Jiang focused on layered mechanical and chemical filters. Yasunaga applied natural compounds through a liquid spray. Wu designed a water-based system that is simple and adaptable. Paño and colleagues used snail shell-derived lime as a sustainable absorbent. Together they show that emission control can be pursued through physical, chemical, biological, or natural material-based methods. Each approach responds to different needs. Multi-layered filters aim for comprehensive treatment. Liquid sprays offer convenience. Water-based systems support affordability. Biogenic powders promote sustainability. These options provide clear examples of how emission problems can be addressed in diverse and practical ways.

Difference in CO Emissions Before and After Installation of CO-SAFE with Activated Coconut Shell and Eggshells Filter

This section focuses on the use of activated coconut shell carbon and eggshell-derived calcium carbonate as natural adsorbents in the CO-SAFE system. Both are low-cost, locally available, and environmentally sustainable. They are also backed by existing studies on their adsorption capacity and their potential for reducing exhaust emissions.

Activated carbon from coconut shells has long been recognized for its high adsorption efficiency due to its porous structure and large surface area. Research has shown that it effectively captures toxic gases, including carbon monoxide, through physical adsorption mechanisms (Manocha, 2011). The presence of micropores in activated carbon creates multiple sites for gas molecules to attach, which enhances its filtration performance. Coconut shells are widely available in the Philippines, making them a practical raw material for producing activated carbon. This not only provides a sustainable solution to exhaust gas filtration but also supports waste-to-resource strategies by converting agricultural waste into valuable adsorbent material.

Eggshell waste, composed of about 95 percent calcium carbonate, has also been studied as a low-cost adsorbent material. Tsai et al. (2006) reported that ground eggshells are capable of adsorbing gases and organic pollutants due to their reactive surface and porous structure. In exhaust applications, the calcium carbonate in eggshells interacts chemically with gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, enabling partial neutralization and removal from the emission stream. The use of eggshells for this purpose provides a circular economy benefit by reducing solid waste and transforming it into a functional filter medium for pollution control.

While both activated coconut shell carbon and eggshell-derived calcium carbonate are effective in reducing pollutants, their modes of action and strengths differ. Activated carbon is more efficient for physical adsorption and has been found to achieve higher levels of CO reduction compared to eggshell filters. Eggshell calcium carbonate, on the other hand, contributes more strongly to chemical adsorption and has been reported to perform better in reducing hydrocarbons and particulates (Al-Attar & Al-Tamimi, 2017). A direct comparison indicates that coconut shell carbon is the more effective material for targeting CO emissions, but eggshell filters add a complementary benefit by addressing other harmful gases in the exhaust.

The performance of natural adsorbents in exhaust filtration is highly dependent on the operating condition of the vehicle. During idling, emissions are concentrated, and adsorbent filters tend to saturate more quickly, which decreases their efficiency over time. During acceleration, the rapid increase in exhaust flow reduces the contact time between gas molecules and the adsorbent surface, leading to lower levels of CO capture. Under steady cruising conditions, the flow of exhaust gases is more stable, allowing longer interaction with the filter and resulting in higher adsorption efficiency. Stop-and-go traffic, which is common in urban areas such as Mandaue City, produces variable exhaust output that causes fluctuating filter performance (Sharma & Goyal, 2014). These variations highlight the importance of testing the CO-SAFE system under multiple operating conditions to understand its reliability and adaptability in real-world scenarios.

Several studies have explored the effectiveness of hybrid filters that combine activated carbon with calcium carbonate-based adsorbents. Rahman et al. (2020) reported that hybrid filters provide higher pollutant reduction than single-material systems because they take advantage of both physical and chemical adsorption processes. In this design, the activated coconut shell carbon layer serves as the first line of defense by physically adsorbing carbon monoxide. The eggshell calcium carbonate layer then provides a secondary stage of filtration, chemically interacting with the residual gases that pass through. This layered approach enhances the overall performance of the filtration system and aligns with the CO-SAFE design principle of multi-layer emission control. By integrating both materials, CO-SAFE maximizes efficiency and demonstrates the potential of combining agricultural and food waste sources for environmental protection.

Performance of AI-Powered CO Detection System

AI-powered carbon monoxide detection systems improve safety by making gas measurement more accurate. Traditional detectors often struggle with low concentration levels and environmental interference. Research shows that when Pd-doped SnO2 sensors are paired with artificial neural networks, accuracy improves significantly. These systems detect CO even in mixed gas environments with better sensitivity and selectivity. This allows more precise monitoring of air quality in real time. The technology supports consistent results under controlled tests. Our study benefits from these findings because accuracy in measurement is central to preventing poisoning events (Prasad, 2024).

Responsiveness in mobile alerts is another major strength of AI systems. Delayed alerts increase risk because CO exposure causes serious health effects within minutes. Studies show that microcontroller-based systems with wireless modules transmit data quickly to mobile devices. Users receive alerts almost immediately after detection. This helps people take fast action and avoid danger. Vehicle-mounted systems also connect to phones and process data through internet platforms, increasing both reach and speed of communication (Lin & Shengzi, 2016). Real-time alerts are vital to making these detection systems practical for daily use.

The timeliness of alerts depends on low-latency response from sensors. AI-enhanced detectors respond faster than traditional devices. Research shows some sensors react within seconds of exposure. This makes alerts more immediate and improves prevention. Wireless systems also notify multiple users at once, such as families, emergency responders, or managers. This creates a wider safety net during emergencies. Our study can highlight timeliness as a core strength of AI detection systems for real-world safety (Cao, Ma, Zhang, & Wang, 2023).

Reliability under environmental changes is a critical test for CO systems. Temperature, humidity, and air pressure affect sensor output. AI models such as Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks improve reliability by adjusting for these variables. Tests confirm stable detection even under shifting environmental conditions. This makes the systems more suitable for homes, vehicles, and workplaces. Research highlights that reliable detection avoids false alarms and missed warnings. This study gains value by showing how reliability is built into modern AI detectors (Hasbullah et al., 2024).

Fail-safe designs also add to reliability. Some systems include automatic shutoffs for appliances when high CO levels are detected. Others add backup safety features when sensors lose power. These features reduce the risk of exposure even during failure events. Flanc (2003) described detectors that remove power from devices when CO thresholds are exceeded. This prevents further emissions and increases user safety. Fail-safes build confidence in AI systems as dependable protection tools.

Wireless communication makes these systems more dependable over time. Data storage through cloud systems keeps records of CO levels. This allows analysis of patterns and prediction of risks. Users also access past data for safety planning. Research shows that systems with both local detection and cloud monitoring provide stronger performance. AI models learn from stored data to improve detection accuracy. This continuous improvement loop strengthens reliability in future use (Hasbullah et al., 2024).

Together, accuracy, responsiveness, and reliability define the strength of AI-powered CO detection systems. Each factor addresses a weakness of traditional detectors. Accuracy ensures measurement of low concentrations in mixed gases. Responsiveness secures fast mobile alerts that reduce risk. Reliability supports detection even under unstable conditions. Fail-safe features and cloud storage add to long-term dependability. Research supports these systems as effective for both home and industrial safety. Our study will contribute by focusing on these tested strengths and linking them to practical safety benefits.

Contribution of the CO-SAFE System to Climate Change Mitigation & Sustainability

The transportation sector is among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) globally, responsible for nearly a quarter of all CO2 emitted into the environment. Road transport, specifically, releases carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxides which feed global warming and cause climate instability. In the opinion of Huang, Ng, Zhou, and Surawski (2018), eco-driving technologies and emissions-cutting innovations are necessary to ensure road transport becomes sustainable. The CO-SAFE system specifically counters this challenge through the incorporation of advanced monitoring and intelligent filtration mechanisms that limit the leakage of toxic exhaust gases. Not only does this reduce emissions, but it can also increase vehicle fuel efficiency, reducing the carbon footprint. Wickramanayake, Bandara, and Samarasekara (2020) discovered that technologies that provide real-time feedback can enhance fuel economy by up to 16.4%, proving that the inclusion of behavioral change in the form of monitoring systems can greatly reduce emissions. In this sense, CO-SAFE is a pragmatic and scalable technological solution to climate change mitigation in transportation.

In addition to curbing the emission of greenhouse gases, vehicle emissions also lower air quality in cities by emitting hazardous pollutants like hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides. These emissions have profound consequences for both environmental and human health, and the World Health Organization recognizes air pollution as one of the major environmental causes of premature death globally. Observations of Mexico's Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs show that regular inspections and emissions control policies can induce up to 69% reductions in hydrocarbons, 42% reductions in carbon monoxide, and 28% reductions in nitrogen oxides (Huertas, Mogro, Mendoza, Huertas, & Ibarra, 2020). These observations verify that regulations and emission-control systems are essential for enhancing air quality. The CO-SAFE system, by virtue of its ability to filter and neutralize lethal exhaust pollutants in real time, fits into these evidence-based methods by offering a technological answer that not only inhibits emissions at the point of origin but also supports overall environmental policy initiatives. Healthier air is an imperative result of these systems since it decreases the number of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses and improves the general livability of cities.

Besides its technical capability to lower emissions, the CO-SAFE system also enhances sustainability through awareness raising and environmentally conscious behavior encouragement. Behavioral change has been identified as a fundamental aspect of sustainable mobility, with technological measures alone being incapable of adequately dealing with the magnitude of environmental issues (Lee & Park, 2020). Real-time feedback systems prove especially useful in this context since they give drivers instant feedback on fuel consumption and emissions, enabling them to adapt their driving behavior. For instance, Chada, Görges, Ebert, Teutsch, and Subramanya (2022) observed that predictive eco-driving support systems not only resulted in energy savings of up to 10% for electric vehicles but also attained high levels of driver acceptance and long-term adoption of behavior. So, too, Peters, Burguillo, and Arranz (2021) highlight that low-emission zones and behavior feedback systems are most effective when they are integrated together since they reinforce policy and practice in lowering fleet emissions. The real-time monitoring and feedback offered by the CO-SAFE system thus act as a learning tool that enhances drivers and operators' ability to take active roles in climate action. Through promoting awareness in addition to technical innovation, the system makes sure that sustainability is not only realized through technology but through mindful behavioral change as well.

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the CO-SAFE system contributes to sustainability on three interconnected fronts. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle carbon footprints by enhancing fuel efficiency and controlling tailpipe emissions. It improves urban air quality and public health outcomes by filtering harmful pollutants before they are released into the environment. And it fosters a culture of awareness and responsibility by equipping drivers with the knowledge and tools to adopt eco-friendly driving habits. As Ma, Peñasco, and Díaz Anadón (2025) argue, transportation policy and innovation work best when they combine technological advances with behavior-centered strategies, creating synergies that maximize both environmental and social benefits. The CO-SAFE system exemplifies this holistic approach by integrating innovation, policy alignment, and user engagement, making it a promising contributor to climate change mitigation and global sustainability goals.

Furthermore, the contribution of systems like CO-SAFE aligns with international sustainability frameworks and innovation roadmaps. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) highlights that transport-related inventions classified under Y02T—"climate change mitigation technologies in transportation"—are increasingly directed at emission control, eco-driving, and fuel efficiency (WIPO, 2022). Patent trends reveal a growing emphasis on catalytic converters, particulate filters, and intelligent monitoring systems that improve conversion efficiency, particularly during cold-start phases when most harmful emissions occur (Espacenet, 2023). The CO-SAFE system, with its multi-layer filtration and AI-driven CO detection, stands out as a novel integration of these strategies: it combines conventional emission reduction with digital monitoring and real-time feedback, addressing both technological performance and user behavior.

In practical terms, this means that CO-SAFE not only enhances compliance with environmental regulations but also anticipates future mobility standards where sustainability, safety, and smart technologies converge. Recent transport studies argue that the most effective emission control measures are those that combine "hard" engineering innovations with "soft" behavior-inducing interventions (Ma, Peñasco, & Díaz Anadón, 2025). By embedding mobile alerts and intelligent feedback loops, CO-SAFE ensures that drivers and fleet managers remain engaged in the emission-reduction process, bridging the gap between policy goals and everyday practices.

Finally, sustainability is not a static outcome but an evolving process. By lowering carbon emissions, improving urban air quality, and fostering eco-conscious driving behavior, CO-SAFE demonstrates a comprehensive model of climate change mitigation in road transport. Its design reflects the global trend toward integrated solutions—technologies that are technically efficient, socially acceptable, and aligned with regulatory pathways. In this sense, the CO-SAFE system represents more than a filtration device: it is a holistic climate tool, one that links innovation with policy compliance and user empowerment. Such systems, if scaled across vehicle fleets, hold the potential to significantly advance national and international targets for carbon neutrality and sustainable urban development.

Levels of CO Before and After Filtration

Carbon monoxide (CO) gas generated during tunnel blasting poses a severe threat to production safety, and effectively removing CO from the airflow remains a significant technical challenge (Wang, et. al, 2025). They use a device that draws in CO-laden smoke, directing it to a purification coating where it comes into full contact with the gas to achieve efficient CO removal. In verifying the performance of the device, they constructed an experimental platform to comprehensively assess the coating adhesion and high-temperature stability, and designed a prototype of a small-scale, low-resistance CO filtration device. In full-scale simulated tunnel tests conducted by the Kailuan Emergency Rescue Team of the National Mine Rescue, the device demonstrated CO conversion rates of 86.67%, 84.62%, and 81.25% at the initial stages of operation, with regeneration rates as high as 97.06% and 95.74%. The device provides a reliable technical solution for the treatment of CO gas during tunnel blasting processes.

AI-Powered Carbon Monoxide (CO) Detection

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision into remote sensing has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of carbon emission monitoring (Onukwulu et al., 2023). Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are currently a popular research area because of its potential applications, and it discusses the implementation of WSNs for monitoring CO concentration in order to automate the filtration process (Ghagde, et. al, 2023). Carbon Monoxide detection analog sensor MQ7 is a sensor module that has high sensitivity to carbon monoxide and has an onboard potentiometer for sensitivity adjustment. It has 5V power supply, will last long and respond directly.

Chapter III: Methodology

Research Design

The CO-SAFE project employs an experimental research design to evaluate the effectiveness of its AI-powered multi-layer exhaust filtration system in reducing carbon monoxide (CO) emissions in vehicle exhausts. Experimental research design is defined as a study in which participants are randomly assigned to groups that undergo different researcher-imposed treatments, followed by measurements of outcomes to test effects (Creswell, 2014). We will use a controlled environment where we can isolate and test specific components of the filtration system. Data will be collected through real-time CO sensors integrated into the system, with results transmitted to a mobile application. The mobile app will alert the driver when CO levels exceed safe thresholds, prompting immediate action. This approach ensures a rigorous assessment of the system's performance under various conditions. The findings will contribute to developing more effective solutions for reducing vehicular CO emissions.

Research Environment

Mandaue City, a city situated in the central part of Metro Cebu, is one of the cities that have been highly urbanized and industrialized in the Philippines. It comprises a central hub for commerce, manufacturing, and transportation, which has led to the city facing heavy traffic congestion and significant air pollution problems. The emission of vehicles in a densely populated urban area contributes to the increase of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere, of which the city is experiencing. The concentration of factories, warehouses, and major roads such as the Cebu North Road are merging together to the city's air quality problems, this is therefore the perfect place to carry on studies of exhaust gases besides filtering experiments by using new technologies.

The city has been chosen as the research environment because of its pressing pollution problem caused by motor vehicles, which are among the primary contributors to urban air pollution. The exposure of toxic gases such as carbon monoxide to residents, commuters, and workers is a common occurrence; therefore, it is a health risk that should not be taken lightly. By situating the study in Mandaue City, the researchers not only solve a real-world environmental and public health issue but also the practical relevance of their proposed solution is ensured.

The study will be a performance evaluation of the system in the two different environments test conditions are set up, in the laboratory and on the road. In the lab setting, they will simulate different operating conditions to evaluate the performance of the multi-layer smart exhaust filtration system in the release of CO under standard conditions. The results are accurate, and the external variables do not affect them. Meanwhile, field tests will be carried out on vehicles operating within Mandaue City to evaluate the system's performance in actual traffic situations where factors such as idling, acceleration, and varied exhaust output can influence the system. The use of both controlled and real-world testing not only guarantees the scientific accuracy of the results but also their practical applicability towards the solving of Mandaue's urban air pollution challenges.

Research Respondents

This research will utilize purposive sampling in the selection of its participants. Etikan, Musa, and Alkassim (2016) state that purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling technique where participants are selected on the basis of the characteristics they bear or their linkage to the research issue at hand. It is most suitable when the researcher wants to get intensive information from individuals who are "information-rich" and can provide valuable insights. Likewise, Palinkas et al. (2015) highlight that purposive sampling is most useful in applied research where the voice of influential stakeholders is required to assess interventions or innovations. As the CO-SAFE system is a technological innovation that combines exhaust filtration, carbon monoxide sensors, and AI-based monitoring, the research needs respondents who are direct users, technical specialists, or policymakers with expertise in vehicle emissions and sustainability.

The initial sample of respondents is comprised of private car owners and drivers. They are the principal end-users of CO-SAFE and will offer useful insights into the application of the system in day-to-day driving. Their practices regarding vehicle maintenance, fuel usage, and driving habits are critical to knowing how the system can affect efficiency and emissions. Besides that, owners and operators of public transports like tricycle, jeepney, and motor bike drivers will also be added, since they are among the most recurrent road users and urban air polluters. Their comments will assist in establishing the feasibility of fitting CO-SAFE in public utility vehicles, as well as its possible large-scale effect of lowering emissions in populated areas. Both private and public drivers are included to ensure the study accounts for a balanced perspective on adoption from single motorists through mass transport system operators.

There will also be another category of respondents consisting of automotive mechanics and technicians, who have specialized understanding and technical skills on the exhaust systems of vehicles. Their contribution in the research is significant because they are able to evaluate the installation feasibility, determine potential maintenance challenges, and test the compatibility of CO-SAFE in various vehicle models. Their findings will assist in narrowing down the technical usage of the system and ensuring that it is viable in real-time automotive environments. Finally, environmental and transport regulatory staff like LGU representatives, the LTO, and environmental agencies will be part of the study. This is to assess if CO-SAFE is in line with current emission-reduction laws and climate change mitigation policies. Regulatory officials can also offer significant feedback on policy hindrances, incentives, and potential interfacing of CO-SAFE with larger sustainability strategies.

By choosing these specific respondent groups, the research is able to guarantee that more than one viewpoint is covered: the real-life experiences of end-users, the operations knowledge of public transport operators, the technical appraisals of automotive professionals, and policy-focused opinions of regulators. This multi-faceted design ensures that the conclusions of the research are more than just technical efficiency but are also extended to real-world usability, feasibility of large-scale applicability, and policy conformity. Under purposive sampling, the research will hence be in a position to collect well-rounded and highly pertinent data that will facilitate complete appraisal of the CO-SAFE system as an emergent innovation for climate change mitigation and sustainable transport.

Research Procedure

The installation of CO-SAFE follows a clear sequence. The vehicle is first parked on a flat surface with the brake applied. The tailpipe is disconnected from the muffler, and an aluminum tube is secured to the muffler outlet using clamps. A heat shield and fiberglass wool are positioned at the tube opening to resist heat. Inside the tube, an activated coconut shell carbon layer is placed, followed by an eggshell calcium carbonate layer. The AI sensor module is then enclosed in a protected casing near the filter housing. This sensor is connected to a microcontroller and linked to the vehicle power supply. Finally, the microcontroller is paired with the mobile application through Bluetooth or cellular gateway, the tailpipe is reattached, and the system is tested for leaks and heat resistance (Hasbullah et al., 2024).

The testing phase begins with baseline measurements. A calibrated CO analyzer records emissions during idle, acceleration, and steady cruising. Each condition is tested three times per vehicle. After installation of CO-SAFE, the same process is repeated. Emission levels are recorded again, and AI sensor readings are compared with laboratory results. Differences between baseline and post-installation data are analyzed using paired t-tests, while consistency across trials is evaluated with Repeated Measures ANOVA. Sensor accuracy is assessed by computing mean absolute error and correlation with the laboratory analyzer.

Testing runs follow a set duration and frequency. Each trial lasts 20 minutes where road tests extend for 1 week with 1 run per day using three vehicles. Each run follows a fixed 20-minute route that includes both traffic stops and steady driving. Carbon monoxide readings are collected every second, then aggregated per minute for analysis. At least 10 paired trials are targeted to achieve statistical power in comparisons.

User trials with the mobile app are also conducted. Volunteer drivers are recruited and screened for vehicle type and driving habits. The app is installed and paired with each CO-SAFE unit. Drivers receive a short orientation on app features, alerts, and required actions. During 1 week of use, the app tracks emission alerts, notification delays, and driver responses. At the end of the trial, drivers complete a short survey and a subset of five participants take part in interviews. The collected data measures usability, response rates, and system adoption challenges (Valido et al., 2022).

All data are double-checked for accuracy before analysis. Statistical tests measure differences in emissions, consistency of results, and accuracy of the AI system. Findings are then presented in tables and graphs to show clear comparisons between baseline and CO-SAFE performance.

Data Analysis

The data collected in this study will be subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to assess the performance of the CO-SAFE system in reducing carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. To measure efficiency of CO reduction, the percentage reduction will be calculated using the formula:

$Efficiency(\%) = \frac{C_{before} - C_{after}}{C_{before}} \times 100$

where $C_{before}$ represents the average CO concentration before installation and $C_{after}$ represents the concentration after installation. Measures of central tendency (mean) and dispersion (standard deviation) will summarize the reduction results across trials.

The consistency of CO reduction across multiple trials will be analyzed using Repeated Measures ANOVA, which follows the test statistic:

$F = \frac{MS_{between}}{MS_{within}}$

where $MS_{between}$ is the mean square variance between trials and $MS_{within}$ is the mean square variance within trials. A non-significant p-value ($p > 0.05$) would indicate consistent performance of the filtration system.

To determine whether there is a significant difference in CO emissions before and after filtration, a paired t-test will be applied using the formula:

$t = \frac{\bar{d}}{s_d / \sqrt{n}}$

where $\bar{d}$ is the mean of the differences, $s_d$ is the standard deviation of the differences, and $n$ is the sample size. In cases where normality is violated, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test will be used as a non-parametric alternative. To further examine performance under different operating conditions (idle, acceleration, cruising), a Two-Way ANOVA will be applied to evaluate both the main effects and interaction effects.

The AI-powered CO detection system will be assessed by computing its accuracy against calibrated laboratory-grade CO analyzers. Correlation will be analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient:

$r = \frac{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \cdot \sum(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$

where $x_i$ are the AI-based measurements and $y_i$ the reference analyzer measurements. Accuracy will also be expressed through Mean Absolute Error (MAE):

$MAE = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$

where $y_i$ are the actual values and $\hat{y}_i$ are the AI-predicted values. The responsiveness of mobile alerts will be quantified by calculating average notification delay times, while system reliability under varying conditions will be tested using the Chi-square test:

$\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

where $O_i$ are observed values and $E_i$ are expected values of AI system outcomes.

For evaluating the contribution to climate change mitigation, emission factor analysis will be used to quantify reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Comparative trend analysis will then illustrate reductions in pollutants relative to baseline values. Finally, Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) will be conducted to determine whether there are significant differences across multiple dependent variables (CO reduction, AI reliability, and user responsiveness). The MANOVA test statistic can be represented by Wilks' Lambda:

$\Lambda = \frac{|E|}{|E + H|}$

where $E$ is the error matrix and $H$ is the hypothesis matrix.

All tests will be carried out at a 95% confidence level ($\alpha = 0.05$). Results will be presented in tabular and graphical forms, including pre- and post-filtration CO levels, trial consistency plots, AI system error distributions, and greenhouse gas reduction trends.
